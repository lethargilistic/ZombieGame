#Tasks of the agent
* Calculate the Time until each zombie will reach us. Avoid the one that will hit soonest.
* Pick up rocks (2 max)
* Run away from zombie.
** Avoid clusters
* Protect other humans
*Check if position is really really close to the last 1 or 2 positions. If so, make big change in a random direction.

#Traits of zombies
* The Zombies have a 500 visual radius.
* They are chasing humans.
** Can we determine their target?

#Ideas
* Collect rocks when there are no zombies around or they are within your running trajectory.
* Increase speed over time so that other humans who have constant speed are shafted.
*Avoid corners
** Running in a circle.
